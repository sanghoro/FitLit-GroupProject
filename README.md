# FitLit

## Abstract
This project is about making a web application that lets users track their fitness activities, water intake, and sleep patterns. The app has a dashboard that shows personalized fitness data, hydration info, and sleep details by using data fetching. Users can see their detailed information by clicking the 'More User Info' button, and they can also see their friends' list.

## Installation Instructions

Start server by entering 'npm start'

Command + L click the link `http://localhost:8080/`

You can run tests by typing in 'npm test'

You can close the server by 'ctrl + c'

## Learning Goals
Part 1:
- Use object and array prototype methods to perform data manipulation.
- Create a user interface that is easy to use and displays information in a clear way.
- Write DRY, reusable code that follows SRP and trends toward function purity
- Implement a robust testing suite using TDD.
- Make network requests to retrieve data.
- Collaborate productively and professionally as a team. Ensure all team members are able to be heard and contribute throughout the project.

Part 2:
- Work with a local server and make network requests to API endpoints to retrieve and manipulate data.
- Ensure your app follows best practices for accessibility
- Practice talking about your code and high level technical concepts
- Implement feedback from a usability test to improve product
- Improve group workflow.

## Challenges
- Getting a handle on network requests was a complex process that required a few meetings with other groups/rocks/mentors.
- This was the first project wherein we implemented the use of a 3rd party library(Chart.js). This required extra time be taken to learn the basic nuances of said library and handling ways that it may interfere with CSS stylings.
- As the project got bigger, there were some points where it became a challenge to figure out how and what to import/export between certain files.

## Wins
- Overall communication and teamwork for both parts was stellar. Whenever one person was struggling, we would get together on a call or hand off the issue to another teammate with a fresh perspective and this made for consistent progress.
- An inspired idea was to create a second branch of our main branch that we could then create sub branches to test off of before pushing to the main branch. This helped to massively mitigate merge conflicts or confusion in who had what code.
- The use of specific issues in the project board was key in keeping us grounded. We were able to mete out smaller tasks to each other which helped to prevent us needlessly stepping over each other's code.
